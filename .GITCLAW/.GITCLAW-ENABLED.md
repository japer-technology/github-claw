# 🦞 GitClaw: Active

### Delete or rename this file to disable .GITCLAW

.GITCLAW is **explicitly enabled** while this file exists at:

- `.GITHUB-MODE/ACTIVE.md`

## File existence behavior

All `.GITCLAW-*` workflows run `.GITHUB-MODE/lifecycle/active.ts` as the first blocking guard step. If this file is missing, the guard exits non-zero and prints:

> GitClaw disabled by missing .GITCLAW-ENABLED.md

That fail-closed guard blocks all subsequent GITCLAW workflow logic.
