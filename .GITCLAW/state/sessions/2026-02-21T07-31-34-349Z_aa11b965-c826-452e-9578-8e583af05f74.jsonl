When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum, but shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) scatter much more than longer wavelengths (red/orange).\n\nBlue light scatters about 10× more than red light because Rayleigh scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength (λ⁻⁴).\n\nYou might wonder: why not violet, since it's even shorter? Two reasons:\n1. The sun emits less violet light than blue\n2. Our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet\n\nSo we perceive the scattered light as blue!"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-6","usage":{"input":1690,"output":201,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":1891,"cost":{"input":0.008450000000000001,"output":0.005025,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.013475}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771659094726}}
