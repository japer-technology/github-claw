## How GitClaw Works — In 30 Seconds

1. **Drop** the `.github-claw` folder into any GitHub repo.
2. **Move** the agent workflow and add your LLM API key.
3. **Open an issue** — the agent reads it, thinks, and replies as a comment.
4. **Comment** on the same issue to continue the conversation. The agent remembers everything.

All conversations are committed to git. The agent has long-term memory, full auditability, and zero infrastructure to maintain.
